# The Thinker - GitHub Copilot Custom Agent

A brainstorming agent that analyzes structured documentation and generates creative, actionable ideas.

## Overview

**The Thinker** is a GitHub Copilot Custom Agent designed to support brainstorming and idea generation. It reads documents from an input folder (containing data structures, process rules, contracts, etc.) and generates well-structured ideas in markdown format in an output folder.

## Best Practices

### For Input Documents

1. **Keep them current** - Update documents as your system evolves
2. **Be specific** - Provide detailed information for better ideas
3. **Structure clearly** - Use headings, lists, and code blocks
4. **Cross-reference** - Link related concepts across documents

### For Idea Generation

1. **Provide context** - Tell the agent what area to focus on
2. **Be specific** - Ask for concrete outcomes
3. **Iterate** - Refine ideas through conversation
4. **Review output** - Always validate generated ideas

### Adding New Documents

To add new input documents:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `input/` folder
2. Structure it clearly with headings
3. Use the agent to analyze the new content
4. Update this README with the new document description

## Customization

### Modifying the Agent

Edit `.github/agents/the-thinker/agent.yml` to:
- Change the agent's behavior
- Add new capabilities
- Adjust the tone and style
- Include domain-specific knowledge

### Example Customizations

**Focus on a specific domain:**
```yaml
instructions: |
  You specialize in fintech applications...
```

**Add technical constraints:**
```yaml
instructions: |
  Always consider: scalability, security, cost...
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Ideation
```
User: @the-thinker Generate ideas for improving our review process

Output: Creates ideas for multi-stage reviews, reviewer assignment, 
        review templates, etc.
```

### Example 2: Security Analysis
```
User: @the-thinker What security improvements can you suggest based on 
      our contracts and data structures?

Output: Analyzes SLA, data processing agreements, and proposes 
        security enhancements
```

### Example 3: Process Optimization
```
User: @the-thinker Compare our registration and project creation 
      workflows. What can we optimize?

Output: Identifies common patterns, suggests consolidation 
        opportunities, proposes streamlined flows
```

## Contributing

To add value to The Thinker:

1. **Enhance input documents** - Add more detailed documentation
2. **Share generated ideas** - Commit valuable outputs to the repo
3. **Improve the agent** - Refine the agent.yml configuration
4. **Document patterns** - Add examples and use cases

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start broad, then narrow** - Begin with general questions, then dive deep
2. **Iterate on ideas** - Ask for refinements or alternatives
3. **Validate assumptions** - Verify that generated ideas match your requirements
4. **Cross-reference** - Ask the agent to explain connections between documents
5. **Regular updates** - Keep input documents current for relevant ideas

## Limitations

- The agent works best with well-structured markdown documents
- Ideas are suggestions and should be validated by domain experts
- The agent cannot access external systems or databases
- Quality of output depends on quality and completeness of input documents

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to The Thinker:
- Template library for common idea types
- Integration with issue tracking
- Automated idea prioritization scoring
