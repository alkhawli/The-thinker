4. **Cross-reference** - Link to related concepts in other documents
5. **Version important changes** - Note significant updates

### File Naming

Use descriptive, lowercase, hyphenated names:
- ✅ `api-specifications.md`
- ✅ `security-policies.md`
- ✅ `deployment-guide.md`
- ❌ `doc1.md`
- ❌ `MyDocument.md`

## Using Documents with The Thinker

Once you add new documents, you can:

1. **Ask for analysis:**
   ```
   @the-thinker Analyze the new [document-name].md and identify key opportunities
   ```

2. **Compare documents:**
   ```
   @the-thinker Compare [doc1].md with [doc2].md and suggest improvements
   ```

3. **Generate focused ideas:**
   ```
   @the-thinker Based on [document-name].md, generate ideas for [specific area]
   ```

4. **Cross-document insights:**
   ```
   @the-thinker What patterns do you see across all our input documents?
   ```

## Maintenance

**Regular Reviews:**
- Monthly: Check for outdated information
- Quarterly: Comprehensive review of all documents
- After major changes: Update affected documents immediately

**Quality Checks:**
- Ensure consistency across documents
- Verify cross-references are valid
- Check that examples are current
- Remove deprecated content

## Document Categories

Organize your documents by category for easier management:

### Core Documents (Always Present)
- Data structures

- System architecture

### Optional Documents

- Integration guides
- Testing strategies
- Performance benchmarks
- Analytics reports

### Living Documents (Frequently Updated)

- **contracts.md**: Example of policy and agreement documentation
- **system-architecture.md**: Comprehensive technical architecture guide

## Questions?

If you're unsure about what to document or how to structure it:

1. Review existing documents for patterns
2. Ask The Thinker: `@the-thinker What information would be helpful to document about [topic]?`
3. Start with a simple structure and refine over time
